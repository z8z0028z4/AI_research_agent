### **Commit Message**

```
fix(deps): Generalize PyTorch dependencies for broader compatibility

Removes the hardcoded CUDA-specific version for `torch` and `torchaudio` in `requirements.txt` to prevent installation errors on systems with different Python versions or without a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA toolkit.

**Problem:**

The `requirements.txt` file previously specified a version of `torchaudio` with a CUDA-specific build (`torchaudio==2.5.1+cu121`) and included a `--extra-index-url` pointing to the PyTorch CUDA repository. This caused `pip install` to fail in environments that did not match these specific requirements, such as:
* Different Python versions.
* Systems without an NVIDIA GPU.
* Systems with a different CUDA version installed.

**Solution:**

This commit resolves the issue by:

1.  **Removing the CUDA-specific versioning:** The `torchaudio` dependency is changed from `torchaudio==2.5.1+cu121` to a more general `torchaudio>=2.0.0`.
2.  **Removing the extra index URL:** The `--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` line has been removed.
3.  **Adding guidance for GPU users:** Comments have been added to the `requirements.txt` file to instruct users who wish to use GPU acceleration on how to install the appropriate version of PyTorch for their system.

This approach makes the installation process more robust by defaulting to a CPU-compatible version of PyTorch, which will work for all users, while still providing a clear path for GPU users to install an optimized build.
