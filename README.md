## üöÄ Project Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the development environment running.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   **Python**: Version 3.10 or 3.11.
-   **Node.js**: Version 16.0 or higher.
-   **Git**: Required for cloning the repository.

### 2. Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI_research_agent.git](https://github.com/your-username/AI_research_agent.git)
    cd AI_research_agent
    ```

2.  **Configure API Keys**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example file.
    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file and add your API keys.
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```

3.  **Run the Setup Script (Windows)**
    This is the recommended method for Windows users. Double-click or run the script from your terminal.
    ```bash
    simple_setup.bat
    ```
    This script will automatically:
    -   Create a shared Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
    -   Install all required Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    -   Install all Node.js dependencies for the frontend from `frontend/package.json`.
    -   Run a dependency check to ensure the environment is correctly configured.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Start the Application

The simplest way to start both the backend and frontend services is to run the main startup script.

```bash
start_react.bat
